# SPA-using-JS
I tried to implement **Routing** in a **single page application** using **Vanilla JavaScript**.

- Navigate throughout the SPA, WITHOUT page re-load
- PrivateRoutes implemented 
- History [You can go back and forth with the links]
- Redirects if not authenticated.
- 404 page, for wrong links
- Authentaication for Private Routes.
